# React Web App with AWS Backend

This project was created using React and AWS Amplify. This app contains user authentication which allows for individual account creation and management. This app also contains a scalable GraphQL API that has been configured with an Amazon DynamoDB database, which provides users with a platform to create or delete notes. Additionally, file storage has been added using Amazon S3 enabling users to upload images and view them in the app.
